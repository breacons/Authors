_The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square_.  [_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_, _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall_.  _On the right is the entrance to the music-room_.  _The sound of a string quartette is faintly heard_.  _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_.  MRS. MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated together on a Louis Seize sofa_.  _They are types of exquisite fragility_.  _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_. _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.]  MRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?  LADY BASILDON.  I suppose so.  Are you?  MRS. MARCHMONT.  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?  LADY BASILDON.  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I go anywhere.  MRS. MARCHMONT.  I come here to be educated.  LADY BASILDON.  Ah! I hate being educated!  MRS. MARCHMONT.  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come here to try to find one.  LADY BASILDON.  [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose. The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time.  MRS. MARCHMONT.  How very trivial of him!  LADY BASILDON.  Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?  MRS. MARCHMONT.  About myself.  LADY BASILDON.  [_Languidly_.]  And were you interested?  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Shaking her head_.]  Not in the smallest degree.  LADY BASILDON.  What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Rising_.]  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!  [_They rise and go towards the music-room_.  _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a young attaché known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]  MASON.  [_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]  Mr. and Lady Jane Barford.  Lord Caversham.  [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the riband and star of the Garter_.  _A fine Whig type_.  _Rather like a portrait by Lawrence_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Has my good-for-nothing young son been here?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Smiling_.]  I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  Why do you call Lord Goring good-for-nothing?  [MABEL CHILTERN _is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness_, _the apple-blossom type_.  _She has all the fragrance and freedom of a flower_.  _There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and the little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the mouth of a child_.  _She has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the astonishing courage of innocence_.  _To sane people she is not reminiscent of any work of art_.  _But she is really like a Tanagra statuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told so_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Because he leads such an idle life.  MABEL CHILTERN.  How can you say such a thing?  Why, he rides in the Row at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week, changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night of the season.  You don’t call that leading an idle life, do you?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes_.] You are a very charming young lady!  MABEL CHILTERN.  How sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham!  Do come to us more often.  You know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you look so well with your star!  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Never go anywhere now.  Sick of London Society. Shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the right side.  But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my wife’s milliner.  Never could stand Lady Caversham’s bonnets.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh, I love London Society!  I think it has immensely improved.  It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics.  Just what Society should be.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Hum!  Which is Goring?  Beautiful idiot, or the other thing?  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Gravely_.]  I have been obliged for the present to put Lord Goring into a class quite by himself.  But he is developing charmingly!  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Into what?  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_With a little curtsey_.]  I hope to let you know very soon, Lord Caversham!  MASON.  [_Announcing guests_.]  Lady Markby.  Mrs. Cheveley.  [_Enter_ LADY MARKBY _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY.  LADY MARKBY _is a pleasant_, _kindly_, _popular woman_, _with gray hair à la marquise and good lace_. MRS. CHEVELEY, _who accompanies her_, _is tall and rather slight_.  _Lips very thin and highly-coloured_, _a line of scarlet on a pallid face_. _Venetian red hair_, _aquiline nose_, _and long throat_.  _Rouge accentuates the natural paleness of her complexion_.  _Gray-green eyes that move restlessly_.  _She is in heliotrope_, _with diamonds_.  _She looks rather like an orchid_, _and makes great demands on one’s curiosity_.  _In all her movements she is extremely graceful_.  _A work of art_, _on the whole_, _but showing the influence of too many schools_.]  LADY MARKBY.  Good evening, dear Gertrude!  So kind of you to let me bring my friend, Mrs. Cheveley.  Two such charming women should know each other!  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Advances towards_ MRS. CHEVELEY _with a sweet smile_. _Then suddenly stops_, _and bows rather distantly_.]  I think Mrs. Cheveley and I have met before.  I did not know she had married a second time.  LADY MARKBY.  [_Genially_.]  Ah, nowadays people marry as often as they can, don’t they?  It is most fashionable.  [_To_ DUCHESS OF MARYBOROUGH.] Dear Duchess, and how is the Duke?  Brain still weak, I suppose?  Well, that is only to be expected, is it not?  His good father was just the same.  There is nothing like race, is there?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Playing with her fan_.]  But have we really met before, Lady Chiltern?  I can’t remember where.  I have been out of England for so long.  LADY CHILTERN.  We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.  MRS. CHEVELEY [_Superciliously_.]  Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my schooldays.  I have a vague impression that they were detestable.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Coldly_.]  I am not surprised!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_In her sweetest manner_.]  Do you know, I am quite looking forward to meeting your clever husband, Lady Chiltern.  Since he has been at the Foreign Office, he has been so much talked of in Vienna. They actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers.  That in itself is fame, on the continent.  LADY CHILTERN.  I hardly think there will be much in common between you and my husband, Mrs. Cheveley!  [_Moves away_.]  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  Ah! chère Madame, queue surprise!  I have not seen you since Berlin!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Not since Berlin, Vicomte.  Five years ago!  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  And you are younger and more beautiful than ever. How do you manage it?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  By making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming people like yourself.  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  Ah! you flatter me.  You butter me, as they say here.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Do they say that here?  How dreadful of them!  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  Yes, they have a wonderful language.  It should be more widely known.  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _enters_.  _A man of forty_, _but looking somewhat younger_.  _Clean-shaven_, _with finely-cut features_, _dark-haired and dark-eyed_.  _A personality of mark_.  _Not popular—few personalities are_.  _But intensely admired by the few_, _and deeply respected by the many_.  _The note of his manner is that of perfect distinction_, _with a slight touch of pride_.  _One feels that he is conscious of the success he has made in life_.  _A nervous temperament_, _with a tired look_. _The firmly-chiselled mouth and chin contrast strikingly with the romantic expression in the deep-set eyes_.  _The variance is suggestive of an almost complete separation of passion and intellect_, _as though thought and emotion were each isolated in its own sphere through some violence of will-power_.  _There is nervousness in the nostrils_, _and in the pale_, _thin_, _pointed hands_.  _It would be inaccurate to call him picturesque_.  _Picturesqueness cannot survive the House of Commons_. _But Vandyck would have liked to have painted his head_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Good evening, Lady Markby!  I hope you have brought Sir John with you?  LADY MARKBY.  Oh! I have brought a much more charming person than Sir John.  Sir John’s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has become quite unbearable.  Really, now that the House of Commons is trying to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I hope not, Lady Markby.  At any rate we do our best to waste the public time, don’t we?  But who is this charming person you have been kind enough to bring to us?  LADY MARKBY.  Her name is Mrs. Cheveley!  One of the Dorsetshire Cheveleys, I suppose.  But I really don’t know.  Families are so mixed nowadays.  Indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Mrs. Cheveley?  I seem to know the name.  LADY MARKBY.  She has just arrived from Vienna.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah! yes.  I think I know whom you mean.  LADY MARKBY.  Oh! she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant scandals about all her friends.  I really must go to Vienna next winter. I hope there is a good chef at the Embassy.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  If there is not, the Ambassador will certainly have to be recalled.  Pray point out Mrs. Cheveley to me.  I should like to see her.  LADY MARKBY.  Let me introduce you.  [_To_ MRS. CHEVELEY.]  My dear, Sir Robert Chiltern is dying to know you!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Bowing_.]  Every one is dying to know the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.  Our attachés at Vienna write to us about nothing else.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you, Sir Robert.  An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.  It starts in the right manner.  And I find that I know Lady Chiltern already.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Really?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  She has just reminded me that we were at school together.  I remember it perfectly now.  She always got the good conduct prize.  I have a distinct recollection of Lady Chiltern always getting the good conduct prize!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Smiling_.]  And what prizes did you get, Mrs. Cheveley?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  My prizes came a little later on in life.  I don’t think any of them were for good conduct.  I forget!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am sure they were for something charming!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I don’t know that women are always rewarded for being charming.  I think they are usually punished for it!  Certainly, more women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers than through anything else!  At least that is the only way I can account for the terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in London!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What an appalling philosophy that sounds!  To attempt to classify you, Mrs. Cheveley, would be an impertinence.  But may I ask, at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist?  Those seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I’m neither.  Optimism begins in a broad grin, and Pessimism ends with blue spectacles.  Besides, they are both of them merely poses.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You prefer to be natural?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  But it is such a very difficult pose to keep up.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What would those modern psychological novelists, of whom we hear so much, say to such a theory as that?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Ah! the strength of women comes from the fact that psychology cannot explain us.  Men can be analysed, women . . . merely adored.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You think science cannot grapple with the problem of women?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Science can never grapple with the irrational.  That is why it has no future before it, in this world.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And women represent the irrational.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Well-dressed women do.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a polite bow_.]  I fear I could hardly agree with you there.  But do sit down.  And now tell me, what makes you leave your brilliant Vienna for our gloomy London—or perhaps the question is indiscreet?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Questions are never indiscreet.  Answers sometimes are.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Well, at any rate, may I know if it is politics or pleasure?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Politics are my only pleasure.  You see nowadays it is not fashionable to flirt till one is forty, or to be romantic till one is forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy.  And philanthropy seems to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow-creatures.  I prefer politics.  I think they are more . . . becoming!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  A political life is a noble career!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  And sometimes it is a clever game, Sir Robert.  And sometimes it is a great nuisance.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Which do you find it?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I?  A combination of all three.  [_Drops her fan_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Picks up fan_.]  Allow me!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But you have not told me yet what makes you honour London so suddenly.  Our season is almost over.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! I don’t care about the London season!  It is too matrimonial.  People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from them.  I wanted to meet you.  It is quite true.  You know what a woman’s curiosity is.  Almost as great as a man’s!  I wanted immensely to meet you, and . . . to ask you to do something for me.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I hope it is not a little thing, Mrs. Cheveley.  I find that little things are so very difficult to do.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a moment’s reflection_.]  No, I don’t think it is quite a little thing.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am so glad.  Do tell me what it is.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Later on.  [_Rises_.]  And now may I walk through your beautiful house?  I hear your pictures are charming.  Poor Baron Arnheim—you remember the Baron?—used to tell me you had some wonderful Corots.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With an almost imperceptible start_.]  Did you know Baron Arnheim well?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Smiling_.]  Intimately.  Did you?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  At one time.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Wonderful man, wasn’t he?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_After a pause_.]  He was very remarkable, in many ways.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I often think it such a pity he never wrote his memoirs. They would have been most interesting.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes: he knew men and cities well, like the old Greek.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Without the dreadful disadvantage of having a Penelope waiting at home for him.  MASON.  Lord Goring.  [_Enter_ LORD GORING.  _Thirty-four_, _but always says he is younger_. _A well-bred_, _expressionless face_.  _He is clever_, _but would not like to be thought so_.  _A flawless dandy_, _he would be annoyed if he were considered romantic_.  _He plays with life_, _and is on perfectly good terms with the world_.  _He is fond of being misunderstood_.  _It gives him a post of vantage_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Good evening, my dear Arthur!  Mrs. Cheveley, allow me to introduce to you Lord Goring, the idlest man in London.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I have met Lord Goring before.  LORD GORING.  [_Bowing_.]  I did not think you would remember me, Mrs. Cheveley.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  My memory is under admirable control.  And are you still a bachelor?  LORD GORING.  I . . . believe so.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  How very romantic!  LORD GORING.  Oh! I am not at all romantic.  I am not old enough.  I leave romance to my seniors.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Lord Goring is the result of Boodle’s Club, Mrs. Cheveley.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  He reflects every credit on the institution.  LORD GORING.  May I ask are you staying in London long?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  That depends partly on the weather, partly on the cooking, and partly on Sir Robert.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You are not going to plunge us into a European war, I hope?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  There is no danger, at present!  [_She nods to_ LORD GORING, _with a look of amusement in her eyes_, _and goes out with_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  LORD GORING _saunters over to_ MABEL CHILTERN.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  You are very late!  LORD GORING.  Have you missed me?  MABEL CHILTERN.  Awfully!  LORD GORING.  Then I am sorry I did not stay away longer.  I like being missed.  MABEL CHILTERN.  How very selfish of you!  LORD GORING.  I am very selfish.  MABEL CHILTERN.  You are always telling me of your bad qualities, Lord Goring.  LORD GORING.  I have only told you half of them as yet, Miss Mabel!  MABEL CHILTERN.  Are the others very bad?  LORD GORING.  Quite dreadful!  When I think of them at night I go to sleep at once.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Well, I delight in your bad qualities.  I wouldn’t have you part with one of them.  LORD GORING.  How very nice of you!  But then you are always nice.  By the way, I want to ask you a question, Miss Mabel.  Who brought Mrs. Cheveley here?  That woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out of the room with your brother?  MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh, I think Lady Markby brought her.  Why do you ask?  LORD GORING.  I haven’t seen her for years, that is all.  MABEL CHILTERN.  What an absurd reason!  LORD GORING.  All reasons are absurd.  MABEL CHILTERN.  What sort of a woman is she?  LORD GORING.  Oh! a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night!  MABEL CHILTERN.  I dislike her already.  LORD GORING.  That shows your admirable good taste.  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  [_Approaching_.]  Ah, the English young lady is the dragon of good taste, is she not?  Quite the dragon of good taste.  LORD GORING.  So the newspapers are always telling us.  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I read all your English newspapers.  I find them so amusing.  LORD GORING.  Then, my dear Nanjac, you must certainly read between the lines.  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I should like to, but my professor objects.  [_To_ MABEL CHILTERN.]  May I have the pleasure of escorting you to the music-room, Mademoiselle?  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Looking very disappointed_.]  Delighted, Vicomte, quite delighted!  [_Turning to_ LORD GORING.]  Aren’t you coming to the music-room?  LORD GORING.  Not if there is any music going on, Miss Mabel.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Severely_.]  The music is in German.  You would not understand it.  [_Goes out with the_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  LORD CAVERSHAM _comes up to his son_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir! what are you doing here?  Wasting your life as usual!  You should be in bed, sir.  You keep too late hours!  I heard of you the other night at Lady Rufford’s dancing till four o’clock in the morning!  LORD GORING.  Only a quarter to four, father.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Can’t make out how you stand London Society.  The thing has gone to the dogs, a lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing.  LORD GORING.  I love talking about nothing, father.  It is the only thing I know anything about.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  You seem to me to be living entirely for pleasure.  LORD GORING.  What else is there to live for, father?  Nothing ages like happiness.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  You are heartless, sir, very heartless!  LORD GORING.  I hope not, father.  Good evening, Lady Basildon!  LADY BASILDON.  [_Arching two pretty eyebrows_.]  Are you here?  I had no idea you ever came to political parties!
